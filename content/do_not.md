Its really hard times for being cs student nowadays. Everything changes faster than other areas. We need to unbelievable adaptation skills more than ever. We need to do not lose our faith. The worst thing could happen a person to lose their faith what he/she really wants to. 

For now, I feel a lot. I feel like missed all oppurtunities. But I told myself this sentence yesterday "If I can not accept my missing,may be i miss my future winnings". Worst sentence ever btw. :D 

My words could seem written by crazy linkedin influencers but believe me i write this sentences from my heart and a little bit from my mind. Do not lose your faith. Even if the worst scenario there must be a path for us. I hope there will. I like what I doing and other things happen to me do not change this. Living in a 3rd world country (lack of merit, lack of justice) do not influence your faith. If I create value, there must be receiver in somewhere. Maybe it will be not in my greatest country but somewhere else. 

The long and the short of it believe in yourself, do not affect from outside world. Create valuable things, push yourself to limits.

(I DO NOT ACT LIKE A TEACHER. I am also suffer from same issues as you like. I also recommend all of them to myself)
